# TODO
# Your program should accept the name of a house as a command-line argument.
#     If the incorrect number of command-line arguments are provided, your program should print an error and exit.
# Your program should query the students table in the students.db database for all of the students in the specified house.
# Your program should then print out each studentâ€™s full name and birth year (formatted as, e.g., Harry James Potter, born 1980 or Luna Lovegood, born 1981).
#     Each student should be printed on their own line.
#     Students should be ordered by last name. For students with the same last name, they should be ordered by first name.
